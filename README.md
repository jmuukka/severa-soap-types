# Visma Severa SOAP API Types

Visma Severa is a project management SaaS product created by Visma Solutions Oy.

Visma Severa has a SOAP API for accessing your own data.

This package contains F# types generated by WsdlService type provider. It also contains many type aliases to simplify accessing the types. The SOAP API does not provide some of the types therefore they are included as they appear in the documentation.

By using this package your compile times will be much faster. When you use the WsdlService then development is quite slow because the type provider will generate the types every time you will build.
